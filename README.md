# CODECRAFT
The fusion of coding and digital art lacks a unified platform where developers can seamlessly create, showcase, and monetize their generative artwork. Traditional digital art platforms primarily cater to static or manually designed visuals, offering little to no support for real-time code execution in an interactive environment. This restricts the creative potential of programmers who use code as their artistic medium. Additionally, existing solutions do not facilitate *collaborative coding, limiting the ability of artists to work together in real-time. Furthermore, the absence of seamless NFT integration makes it difficult for creators to mint, sell, and securely transfer ownership of their digital assets. Without a structured ecosystem that supports live execution, collaboration, and Blockchain-based monetization, the potential of creative coding remains largely untapped in the digital art space.

The proposed platform will bridge the gap between digital art and programming, offering a secure marketplace where users can buy and sell generative art created through code. By keeping the code private and displaying only the final output, the platform protects the intellectual property of the sellers while providing an engaging and interactive experience for the buyers. This will unlock new creative possibilities and business opportunities for both artists and buyers in the digital art world.
